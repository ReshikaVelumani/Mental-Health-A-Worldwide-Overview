### Mental Health Visualisation
Mental illness is an exponentially growing global problem.More than 4.4% of the world’s population (one in four people) suffer from mental health related issues. Such alarming figures reflect the wider prevalence of mental ill-health. Via this project, we aim to get a relation between different factors that affect mental disorders through numerous visualizations.
### Getting Started
#### Data Description
To visually see the relationship between different factors and mental health, we divided the enitre project into four main tasks. They are 
##### GDP and Mental Health: Does Money Buy Happiness?
For this task we used a dataset containing the gross domestic product (GDP) of each country and its percentage of depressed people.
##### Mental Health and Employment
We utilised the data collected in Survey of mental health in technical companies available on Kaggle for this task.Specifically, the survey measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in technological workplaces.
##### Suicide: A comorbidity of Mental Health
 A dataset obtained from the ‘Mental Health Survey’ data published by Our World in Data was used for this task. The data has three main features, i.e., name of the country, its suicide rate due to mental health issues, and population of the country.
 ##### #BreakTheStigma: A Social Media Delusion?
 Twitter data was crawled for about 10 days and tweets containing keywords like panic attack, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder , #breakthestigma etc. was extracted.
### Prerequisites
Python, R and D3.js are the programming languages used.
### How to run the code
1. Tableau was used to visulaise the first task. The visualisation was published in Tableau public.

2. The second task was performed using R. Running the R code will do the need.
3. The third task was done using D3.js. yout have to run the code using localhost server.
4. Python's plotly library was utilised for the fourth task.Running the parallel_coordinates.ipynb file will be do the need
